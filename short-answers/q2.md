# Question

Why do you need labels for every input? What are the two ways to associate a label with an input?

# Answer

Labels are needed to ensure that your website is accessible. You can associate a label tag with an input tag by having the two tags be siblings and using the `for` attribute in the label tag.

### For example:

```html
<!-- the for tag of the label -->
<!--         vvvvvvv                        -->
<label for="age-input">Age:</label>
<input type="number" id="age-input" name="age" />
<!--                      ^^^^^^^           -->
<!-- matches the id tag of the input -->
```

The other way to associate a label tag with an input tag is by nesting the input tag within the label tag.

### For Example:

```html
<label>
  Age:
  <input type="number" name="age" />
</label>
```
