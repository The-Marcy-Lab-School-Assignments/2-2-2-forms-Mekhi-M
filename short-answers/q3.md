# Question

Take these 4 html buttons:

```html
<button></button>
<button type="submit"></button>
<button type="reset"></button>
<button type="button"></button>
```

What is the default behavior of each button when clicked?

# Answer

`<button></button>`
This button's type attribute will automatically be set to submit and so it will act like a submit type button.

`<button type="submit"></button>`
This will submit data from a form to the server by default.

`<button type="reset"></button>`
This will set every input element associated with the button back to their initial values.

`<button type="button"></button>`
This button will not have any default behavior and will do nothing when clicked.
